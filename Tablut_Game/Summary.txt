Project Description: 

Tablut is played on a 9x9 checkerboard between a set of 9 white pieces and 16 black pieces. 
The middle square is called the throne. One of the white pieces is the king, and the others, 
his guards, are known as Swedes. The white side wins if the king reaches one of the edges of 
the board. The black pieces are known as Muscovites. Their aim is to capture the king before 
he reaches the edge of the board. Two players will participate in this game and the player who chooses black side goes first.
